			<li>
				Renter's Insurance is a policy that provides some of the benefits of homeowners insurance, but does NOT include 
				coverage for the dwelling, or structure, with the exception of small attractions that the tenant makes to the structure. It provides
				liability insurance, and the tenants personal property is covered against known problems such as fire, theft, vandalism, etc. It
				also pays expenses when the dwelling becomes uninhabitable.
			</li>
		</div>
		<div id = "#whatl">
		Planning to rent out a home to some tenants? You'll need to have yourself some Landlord insurance, as this protects your property
		and allows you to hold the tenants accountable for any damage they cause. The legal system won't just take your word for it, after all.
		</div>
		<div id = "#cost">
		5 Renters: roughly $185/year (before extra costs such as: how much coverage needed, type of coverage, amount of deductable, location)
		Landlord's insurance starts at around $50/month before the additional costs of dwelling coverage, additional structures, and liabiliy.
		</div>
		<div id = "#coverage">
		Both insurances will cover a cost of up to $50,000; if there are items worth more consider extra coverage.
		Renter's insurance covers the cost of belongings lost in a disaster (A.E. fire, lightning, windstorm, hailstorm, etc).
		Renter's insurance covers items lost in a burglary or theft.
		If your home is damaged and uninhabitable, renter's insurance covers the cost of other living arrangements, and the cost of the accident
		that damaged the property.
		Landlord's insurance will cover the cost of the structure itself, other structures on the property (shed, etc), lost rental income
		(if the property is damaged), and some liability for the landlord if an injury lawsuit were to occur.
